Todo:
	- Create a prototype region (will become the save-game file - consider making city the save-game for import/export)
		-> For now create a bunch of buttons that will open an instance (?) of a city
		-> You should only be able to have a single city open at once
	- Create a prototype city (import/export available)
		-> It can be a blank canvas for now
	- Create a prototype building (import/export available)
	- Create a prototype citizen
	- Create a prototype UI

** Gameplay notes **
	-> Main interaction; this is a city-builder game at its heart
		- Should be at the city level
		- Build roads
		- Define lots
		- Build infrastructure
		- Add services (police/fire/hospital/etc)
		- Expand via land purchase
		- Set policies (?)
	-> Detail interaction (building)
		- Change decor
		- Add appliances/furniture
		- Set prices, wages, benefits
	-> Game progression
		- Controlled by PID?
		- Population or income achievements?
		- TBD
		- TBD

** Initial game conditions **
	- Blank slate (nothing exists in cities)
	- Regional government provides funding to start a city
	- Various inter-city connections made available (typical: roads, train)
	- Initially, lots are owned by the city (and purchased by citizens or businesses moving in)
	- Non-domestic businesses will be attracted by cheap land and utilities; high prices will slow development
	- Utilities will NOT be time-gated (except in tutorial), but more specialized utilities will have much higher operating costs
	- Upkeep is required for roads, utilities, etc.
	
** Tutorial **
	- TBD

** Time **
30 minutes a day at timespeed = 1
15 minutes a day at timespeed = 2
 5 minutes a day at timespeed = 6 (render less, you'll be focusing on simulation calcs)
	
** Terrain **
	- Grass
	- Rock
	- Dirt
	- Gravel
	- Water
	- Farmland (special)
	- Other?
	- Defined by biome; world generation could be created later. For now set manually
	
** Resources **
	- Local can be cheaper (no transport costs)
	- Buying in bulk can be cheaper
	- Spawn on top of terrain, must be harvested
	- Some are renewable, others are not
	- Non-renewable resources will still be achievable, but at a lower rate; better to import then
	- Prices will depend on availability on the market
	- Types of resource:
		-> Rock
		-> Ore (metal)
		-> Wood
		-> Water

**Attraction to city** (General attraction)
 Increase if 
	- There are jobs
	- There is entertainment
	- There is commerce (things to buy)
	- There are friends to see
	- Strong health services
	- Small constant "exploration" type value
	- Cost of living (tax, other) is low
	- Quality of life is high

 Decrease if
	- There is significant pollution
	- There is significant crime
	- There is significant noise
	- There is a lack of services

 Types of Attraction
	- Wants to live in the city (too vague)
	- Wants to work in the city (majority)
	- Wants to shop in the city
	- Wants leisure in the city
	- Wants education in the city
	- Park attraction factor
	- Walkable attraction factor
	- Commute attraction factor
	- Night life / entertainment attraction factor
	NOTE: When attracting a citizen, they'll either be generic or specialized.
		-> If attracted by a job, they'll be specialized
		-> The more specialized a job, the more specialized the citizen
		-> Roll the dice as to whether there will really be a job for them - no guarantee

**What creates crime?**
	- Poverty
	- Homelessness
	- Pollution
	- Fire damage?
	- Government corruption?
	- ?
 
**How to move a citizen into the city**
	- Lots must be available (rentable or for sale)
	- In multi-family dwellings you must select which unit
	- Citizens can automatically move in, if enabled
	- Manual move-in is possible.
	- If city is desirable there will be a queue of potential citizens
	- Select one, then purchase based on budget
	- If renting, the citizen must have an income high enough for rent
	- If buying, the citizen must have an income high enough for mortgage, with enough money for down payement
	
** Random notes **
	- Citizens who pay off their mortgage have more potential to start a business
	
** Citizen Traits **
	- Punctuality
	- Work ethic
	- Frugality
	- Physique (body shaming potential?)
	- Risk aversion (more likely to take a 9-5 job)
	- Greed
	- Education (Pre-K->High School->Some College)
		-> While education indicates success, business opportunities are available to all education levels
		-> More educated citizens are likely to have higher earning 9-5 jobs
		-> Business owners stand to earn a lot
		
** Businesses **
	- Are owned
	- Have names
	- Have income and expenses
	- Provide products, services, or both
	- Owners can be citizens, or people who live outside the city
	- Some types can be run from a residence
	- Some types require a physical location
	- Can employ multiple people
		-> If having trouble recruiting, will increase benefits (pay/health/vacation/etc)
		-> If having problems with profit, will decrease benefits (pay/health/vacation/etc)
		-> If an employee loses pay or benefits, will be more likely to leave job
		-> Employment may have education requirements
	- Have domestic or exported sales (services are domestic only, unless it's a travelling service like plumber)
	- Require and/or generate resources
	
** Buildings **
	- Are owned (or bank-owned/vacant)
		-> By businesses/citizens
	- Require time to build
	- Require resources to build
		-> Resource cost scales with size
	- Require labor to build
		-> Imported labor more expensive
		-> Will build slower with imported labor
		-> Can still be built even if no domestic labor
		-> Time and labor cost scale with size / complexity (height/industry/etc)
